  id: "l-ai-1", courseId: "c-ai", topicId: "t-ai-1", order: 1, title: "What Is AI — and What Is It Not?", minutes: 12,
  summary: "Separate the hype from the engineering: AI as pattern-matching systems built from data, rules, and statistics.",
  why: "You cannot use AI well if you think it is magic. Knowing its true nature — and its limits — is what lets you trust it in the right places and verify it everywhere else.",
  objectives: ["Define AI in plain engineering terms", "Distinguish narrow AI from general AI", "Identify everyday systems that are (and are not) AI"],
  sections: [
    { h: "AI as applied pattern-matching", p: "At its core, modern AI is a system that finds patterns in data and uses them to make predictions or decisions. A spam filter has seen millions of emails labeled 'spam' or 'not spam'; it learned statistical patterns — strange sender names, urgent phrasing, suspicious links — and applies them to new mail. There is no understanding in the human sense; there is very good pattern-matching at scale." },
    { h: "Narrow vs. general intelligence", p: "Everything you use today is narrow AI: excellent at one task (translating, recommending, driving) but unable to transfer its skill elsewhere. A chess engine cannot write poetry. Artificial General Intelligence — a system with human-range flexibility — does not exist yet. When you evaluate a tool, always ask: what narrow task was it trained for?" },
  ],
  example: { title: "Three systems, one test", body: "Ask of any system: does it learn from examples and improve? A thermostat follows fixed rules — not AI. A music recommender improves as you listen — AI. A calculator computes exactly — not AI.", code: "thermostat:   if temp > 24 → cool      (rules, no learning)\nrecommender:  history → patterns → pick (learns from data) ✓ AI\ncalculator:   2 + 2 → 4 always          (exact math, no learning)" },
  terms: [["Artificial Intelligence", "Systems that perform tasks normally requiring human-like perception or judgment, by learning patterns from data."], ["Narrow AI", "AI trained for one specific task; all AI in production today."], ["Model", "The learned pattern-matcher: a mathematical function shaped by training data."]],
  activityHint: "Audit three apps you use daily. For each, write one sentence: is it AI, and what narrow task was it trained for?",
  check: { prompt: "A music app recommends songs and improves as you listen. A thermostat cools the room above 24°C. Which statement is correct?", options: ["Both are AI because both are automated", "Only the recommender is AI — it learns from data; the thermostat follows fixed rules", "Only the thermostat is AI — it reacts to the environment", "Neither is AI — automation is not AI"], answer: 1, explain: "The defining trait is learning from examples. The recommender improves from data; the thermostat executes a fixed rule." },
});
L({
  id: "l-ai-2", courseId: "c-ai", topicId: "t-ai-1", order: 2, title: "How AI Systems Learn from Data", minutes: 14,
  summary: "Inputs, labels, training, inference — the pipeline every learning system follows.",
  why: "Every AI failure you will ever debug traces back to data. Understanding the pipeline tells you where quality comes from and where it breaks.",
  objectives: ["Trace the data → training → inference pipeline", "Explain what labels are and why they matter", "Predict how bad data degrades an AI system"],
  sections: [
    { h: "The pipeline: data in, decisions out", p: "A learning system has four stages. (1) Collect examples — photos, emails, sensor readings. (2) Label them — this is a cat, this is spam. (3) Train — an algorithm adjusts millions of internal numbers until its predictions match the labels. (4) Infer — the trained model makes predictions on new, unlabeled data. The model is only as good as each stage allows." },
    { h: "Garbage in, gospel out — the danger", p: "Models do not know your data is biased, outdated, or mislabeled; they learn whatever is there, confidently. If a hiring dataset mostly shows one demographic in senior roles, the model learns that pattern as 'qualified'. This is why data inspection is an engineering discipline, not a footnote — the model will happily amplify whatever the data contains." },
  ],
  example: { title: "House price predictor", body: "You feed 10,000 sales records: size, location, age → sale price. Training finds how each feature pushes price up or down. A new listing gets an estimate. If your records only cover one neighborhood, the model is confident — and wrong — everywhere else.", code: "data:      [size=120m², district=Riverside, age=9y] → price=€310k\ntraining:  adjust weights until predicted ≈ actual (×10,000)\ninference: [size=95m²,  district=Old Town,  age=30y] → price=€???" },
  terms: [["Training data", "The labeled examples a model learns from."], ["Label", "The correct answer attached to an example during training."], ["Inference", "Using the trained model to predict on new data."]],
  activityHint: "Pick a prediction you would like an AI to make. List the 5 data fields you would collect and 2 ways the data could mislead the model.",
  check: { prompt: "A loan-approval model trained only on data from one city is deployed nationwide and performs badly. The most likely root cause is…", options: ["The model has too few parameters", "The training data does not represent the new population", "Inference is slower than training", "The labels were too accurate"], answer: 1, explain: "Models generalize only to situations resembling their training data. Narrow data → narrow competence, applied with unearned confidence." },

// ·· AI ·· Topic 2 — Generative AI
L({
  id: "l-ai-3", courseId: "c-ai", topicId: "t-ai-2", order: 1, title: "How Generative Models Create Content", minutes: 13,
  summary: "Tokens, next-word prediction, and why a statistics engine can write essays, code, and images.",
  why: "Generative AI is the most widely used AI in history. Understanding its mechanism turns you from a passenger into a pilot.",
  objectives: ["Explain token-by-token generation", "Describe why generated text can be factually wrong", "Name two modalities beyond text"],
  sections: [
    { h: "One token at a time", p: "A large language model reads your prompt, converts it to tokens (word pieces), and repeatedly asks: what token most plausibly comes next? Each answer extends the input, and the question repeats — thousands of times per response. The result is fluent because the model has absorbed the statistical shape of human writing, not because it 'knows' the topic." },
    { h: "Fluency ≠ truth", p: "The model optimizes for plausible continuation, not verified facts. When its training data is thin on your question, it still generates — producing confident errors called hallucinations. The practical rule: treat generative output as a brilliant first draft that must be checked against primary sources, especially for numbers, citations, and claims." },
  ],
  example: { title: "Watch a sentence assemble", body: "Prompt: 'The capital of Kenya is'. The model scores candidate tokens and picks the most probable continuation — not by looking it up, but because 'Nairobi' overwhelmingly follows that context in its training data.", code: "input : \"The capital of Kenya is\"\nnext? : [Nairobi 0.94] [Mombasa 0.03] [Kenya 0.01] ...\noutput: \"The capital of Kenya is Nairobi\" (repeat process)" },
  terms: [["Token", "A chunk of text (often a word piece) — the unit models read and emit."], ["Hallucination", "Confidently generated content that is wrong or invented."], ["Modality", "The kind of content a model handles: text, image, audio, code."]],
  activityHint: "Ask an AI assistant one question it will certainly know and one obscure question. Compare confidence vs. accuracy — note where it should have said 'I don't know'.",
  check: { prompt: "Why can a language model produce fluent text that is factually wrong?", options: ["It intentionally deceives users", "It predicts plausible next tokens rather than retrieving verified facts", "It runs out of memory mid-sentence", "It only reads the last word of a prompt"], answer: 1, explain: "Generation is probabilistic continuation. Plausibility is optimized; truth is not — so verification stays your job." },
});
L({
  id: "l-ai-4", courseId: "c-ai", topicId: "t-ai-2", order: 2, title: "Working with AI Assistants on Real Tasks", minutes: 15,
  summary: "A workflow for research, drafting, coding, and review — with verification built into every step.",
  why: "The students who benefit most from AI are not the ones who ask it to do everything, but the ones who build reliable human-plus-AI workflows.",
  objectives: ["Apply a four-step AI workflow to any task", "Verify AI output with primary sources", "Recognize tasks where AI adds little value"],
  sections: [
    { h: "The draft–check–refine workflow", p: "Use AI where it is strongest: generating structure, options, and first drafts. A reliable loop: (1) brief the assistant with context and constraints, (2) generate a draft, (3) verify every claim, number, and reference against a primary source, (4) refine with follow-up instructions. You remain the editor and the accountable author." },
    { h: "Where AI shines — and stalls", p: "Strong: brainstorming, summarizing, explaining concepts, boilerplate code, reformatting, translation. Weak or risky: precise current facts, private/confidential data, final decisions about people (grades, hiring), and anything requiring legal or medical authority. Matching tasks to tool strength is a professional skill, not a limitation." },
  ],
  example: { title: "AI-assisted study plan", body: "Instead of 'make me a study plan', brief the assistant: exam date, syllabus topics, weak areas, 90 minutes/day. Generate the draft, then adjust: move weak topics earlier, add past-paper practice. The plan is yours; the assistant handled the structuring.", code: "brief    → context + constraints + format\ngenerate → draft plan (AI)\nverify   → syllabus coverage, realistic timing (you)\nrefine   → \"move statistics to week 1, add 2 mock exams\"" },
  terms: [["Primary source", "The original authoritative material a claim is checked against."], ["Editor role", "You decide what is correct and publishable; AI proposes."], ["Context window", "How much text the assistant can consider at once — brief it accordingly."]],
  check: { prompt: "You use an AI assistant to summarize a research paper for your project. What is the correct verification step?", options: ["If the summary reads well, it is reliable", "Ask the assistant to confirm its own summary", "Check the summary's claims against the actual paper", "Assume summaries are always more accurate than full text"], answer: 2, explain: "The paper is the primary source. Summaries can drift or invent — the check is always against the original." },

// ·· AI ·· Topic 3 — Prompt Engineering
L({
  id: "l-ai-5", courseId: "c-ai", topicId: "t-ai-3", order: 1, title: "Anatomy of an Effective Prompt", minutes: 14,
  summary: "Role, context, task, format, constraints — the five parts that turn vague asks into precise output.",
  why: "The quality gap between a weak and a strong prompt is often bigger than the gap between AI models. Prompting is engineering: structure beats luck.",
  objectives: ["Structure prompts with the five-part template", "Add constraints that eliminate useless output", "Specify output format up front"],
  sections: [
    { h: "The five-part structure", p: "Strong prompts carry: ROLE (who the model should act as), CONTEXT (what it needs to know), TASK (exactly what to produce), FORMAT (shape of the output — list, table, code), CONSTRAINTS (length, tone, what to avoid). Missing parts are filled by the model's guesses — and guesses are average by design." },
    { h: "Constraints do the heavy lifting", p: "Telling a model what NOT to do is as powerful as saying what to do. 'Explain photosynthesis' returns a textbook wall. Add: 'for a 12-year-old, in 5 bullet points, using a kitchen analogy, no jargon' — and the output becomes useful. Constraints are the difference between content and communication." },
  ],
  example: { title: "Before / after", body: "Same goal, two prompts. The second specifies role, audience, format, and constraints — and gets a usable answer in one shot instead of three rounds of fixing.", code: "BEFORE: \"help me with my cover letter\"\n\nAFTER : \"You are a hiring manager in renewable energy.\n        Rewrite my cover letter draft below for a junior analyst\n        role. Keep it under 200 words, 3 paragraphs, concrete\n        achievements only, no clichés like 'passionate'.\"" },
  terms: [["Prompt", "The full instruction — context included — given to a model."], ["Constraint", "An explicit limit on length, style, or content that narrows output."], ["Few-shot", "Including 1–3 examples in the prompt to demonstrate the pattern."]],
  activityHint: "Rewrite one question you asked an AI this week using all five parts. Compare the two outputs side by side.",
  check: { prompt: "Which prompt is best engineered for the task 'feedback on my app idea'?", options: ["'What do you think of my app idea?'", "'As a product analyst, critique this app idea for students: list 3 risks and 3 strengths in a table, be blunt, under 300 words.'", "'Be nice and tell me my app idea is good'", "'Give me feedback' + pasting 40 pages of notes"], answer: 1, explain: "It supplies role, context, task, format, and constraints — leaving nothing to the model's average-case guessing." },
});
L({
  id: "l-ai-6", courseId: "c-ai", topicId: "t-ai-3", order: 2, title: "Iterating: Test, Evaluate, Refine", minutes: 13,
  summary: "Prompting is a loop, not a single shot: version your prompts and judge output against criteria.",
  why: "Professionals do not get great prompts; they get great at improving prompts. The iteration loop is the transferable skill.",
  objectives: ["Run a versioned prompt-improvement loop", "Evaluate outputs against explicit criteria", "Use few-shot examples to teach a pattern"],
  sections: [
    { h: "Treat prompts like code", p: "Version them. Write v1, observe the failure mode ('too long', 'missed the risks', 'wrong tone'), change one thing, write v2. After three versions you usually know the prompt better than the first draft ever did. Keeping a small library of your proven prompts is a genuine professional asset." },
    { h: "Few-shot: show, don't tell", p: "Sometimes describing the pattern is harder than demonstrating it. Including one or two examples of the input→output you want (few-shot prompting) teaches format and tone more reliably than paragraphs of description. One precise example beats ten adjectives." },
  ],
  example: { title: "The improvement loop", body: "Goal: weekly quiz questions from class notes. v1 returns generic questions. Diagnosis: no difficulty spec. v2 adds 'Bloom's level: apply/analyze' and one example question. v2 output is usable; v3 trims wording. Three versions, each changing one variable.", code: "v1: \"make quiz questions from these notes\"        → too generic\nv2: + criteria + 1 example question (few-shot)    → usable ✓\nv3: + \"max 18 words per question\"                 → polished" },

  objectives: ["Distinguish classification from regression", "Explain features and labels with a concrete example", "Map a real problem to a supervised-learning setup"],
  sections: [
    { h: "Two kinds of prediction", p: "If the label is a category — spam/not spam, fraud/legit, cat/dog — the task is classification. If the label is a number — price, temperature, delivery time — it is regression. The setup is identical: examples with features (inputs) and labels (answers); the model learns the mapping; new features go in, a predicted label comes out." },
    { h: "Features are the vocabulary of the problem", p: "Choosing what to measure is half the engineering. Predicting crop yield? Features might be rainfall, soil nitrogen, and planting date. A model can only use what you measure — unmeasured causes become blind spots. Feature design is where domain knowledge makes models dramatically better." },
  ],
  example: { title: "Same data, two tasks", body: "From bank transaction records you can build both: classify transactions as fraudulent/legitimate (category) or estimate how much a customer will spend next month (number). Same features, different label type, different model output.", code: "features (both): amount, merchant, time, location, history\nclassification: label ∈ {fraud, legit}        → \"flag this? yes/no\"\nregression:     label ∈ numbers (€)           → \"next month: €412\"" },

A simple chatbot may answer a question, while more advanced systems can carry a conversation across several turns. These systems rely on language understanding, context, and response generation." },
    { h: "Translation and speech recognition", p: "Machine translation turns one language into another, such as English to French or Swahili to English. Speech recognition turns spoken words into text, which then allows voice assistants, transcripts, and dictation tools to work. Many modern systems combine both: speech to text, language understanding, and generation back into spoken language." },
